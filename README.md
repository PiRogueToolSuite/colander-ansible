üíª: indicates the commands must be executed on your laptop (Ansible control node)
üì¶: indicates the commands must be executed on your server

# üíª Deployment procedure
The first step is to clone this repository on your laptop (Ansible control node), not on the server. 
```
git clone https://github.com/PiRogueToolSuite/colander-ansible.git
```

Regularly run the following command to update the playbooks:
```
git pull origin main
```

All commands starting with `ansible` must be executed on your laptop.

## üíª Set up your Ansible control node
To make things easier, we recommend copying the SSH key of the user `colander` on your server. 

On your [Ansible control node](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/basic_concepts.html#control-node), run the command to copy it:
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/my-key colander@[IP address of your server]
```

Then, on your laptop, create a Python 3 virtual environment and install the dependencies with the commands: 
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```


## üíª Create your Ansible inventory file
Your inventory file specifies the server on which Colander will be deployed. Rename the file `production-example.yml` to `production.yml` and replace:
* `[IP address of the server]` with the IP address of your server
* `[path of your SSH private key]` with the path of your SSH private key

Ansible will use the specified SSH key to connect to your server, this SSH key corresponds to the one you copied previously.

### Per host customization (optional)
If you want to customize what will be deployed, you can do it per host (server). To do so, in the folder `host_vars`, rename the file `production-example.yml` to `production.yml` in which you can override the default configuration. You can specify that you don't want to use:
* Threatr, by setting `use_threatr` to False
* Cyberchef, by setting `use_cyberchef` to False
* Mandolin, by setting `use_mandolin` to False
* Playwright, by setting `use_playwright` to False

You can also configure the amount of memory that will be allocated to Elasticsearch. See the example below.

Example of host configuration:
```yaml
stack_overrides:
  flavor:
    use_threatr: True
    use_cyberchef: False
    use_mandolin: False
    use_playwright: True
  services:
    elasticsearch:
      xms: 512m
      xmx: 512m
```

## Initial setup of your server 
The latest version Debian must have been installed on your server before you start the deployment. 

### üì¶ Create a user for Colander
Before running Ansible playbooks to install Colander, you must create a user `colander` on your server. Run the following commands on your server:
```
useradd -m colander --shell /bin/bash
usermod -aG sudo colander
passwd colander
```

### üíª Install Docker
Then, it's necessary to install Docker on your server with the playbook `install-docker`:
```
ansible-playbook -K -i production.yml playbooks/install-docker.yml
```

Ansible will ask you to enter the *BECOME password* which corresponds to the password of the user *colander* you have created. The playbook installs Docker in the [rootless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/).


## üíª Generate the configuration of Colander
Before deploying Colander on your server, you must generate its configuration. The generated file contains all the secrets of your Colander server. Most of the secrets are randomly generated.

To generate the configuration, run the command on your laptop:
```
ansible-playbook -i production.yml playbooks/generate-configuration.yml
```

The playbook will ask you to enter the root domain corresponding to your Colander server. Alternatively, you can pass it directly to the command line with: 
```
ansible-playbook -i production.yml playbooks/generate-configuration.yml --extra-vars "root_domain=my.domain"
```

This creates a file `group_vars/colander/vault` in which you must specify:
* `acme_email`: the email address passed to Let's Encrypt
* `admin_name`: the server administrator‚Äôs full name
* `admin_email`: the email address the crash reports will be sent to
* `django_default_from_email`: the email address to use when sending emails
* `email_host`: the host of the SMTP server
* `email_host_user`: the username for the SMTP server
* `email_host_password`: the password for the SMTP server
* `email_port`: the port for the SMTP server
* `email_use_tls`: true if the SMTP server uses TLS, false otherwise
* `email_use_ssl`: true if the SMTP server uses SSL, false otherwise

Finally, back up and encrypt this file as it contains sensitive informations and secrets:
```
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/colander/vault
```

Don't forget to save the password of your vault in your favorite password manager.

‚ö†Ô∏è Before going further, make sure you have configured subdomains pointing to your server:
* `colander.[your domain]`
* `threatr.[your domain]` only if you are planning to deploy Threatr, check your inventory file
* `cyberchef.[your domain]` only if you are planning to deploy Cyberchef, check your inventory file
* `traefik.[your domain]`

As an example, if your domain is `my.domain` and the public IP address of your server is `253.127.98.9`, your A record would look like `colander.my.domain A 253.127.98.9`.

You are now ready to deploy Colander on your server üéâ


## üíª Deploy Colander
You can now deploy Colander on your server. The playbook `colander` configures and deploys for you:
```
ansible-playbook -J -i production.yml playbooks/colander.yml
```

This is equivalent to running:
```
ansible-playbook -J -i production.yml playbooks/configure-colander.yml
ansible-playbook -J -i production.yml playbooks/deploy-colander.yml
```

Depending on your server, the first deployment can take several minutes to complete. The playbook automatically creates the `admin` users for Colander and Threatr (if enabled), and deploys the whole stack on your server.

Colander is now up and accessible on `https://colander.[root domain]/`.

Note that Colander is designed to update itself, but it doesn't update nor upgrade the server operating system.


# Maintenance
## üì¶ Logs
The logs of the Docker containers are redirected to `journald` which is the standard logging service on Debian-based distributions. This allows seamless integration with external tools. As an example, `fail2ban` can be configured to ingest the logs of Colander and automatically block or ban IP addresses after `x` authentication failures.

The logs are tagged in a way that it‚Äôs easy to filter or extract them for a specific container, service, or type of service. As an example, the command `journalctl -f CONTAINER_NAME=colander-colander-front-1` prints the logs of the container `colander-colander-front-1`.

You can use the following variables to filter the logs:
* `IMAGE_NAME`: the name of the Docker image, *e.g.,* `ghcr.io/piroguetoolsuite/colander:main`
* `CONTAINER_NAME`: the name of the container, *e.g.,* `colander-colander-front-1`
* `COLANDER_SERVICE_NAME`: the name of the service, *e.g.,* `colander-front`
* `COLANDER_SERVICE_TYPE`: the type of service, *e.g.,* `web`

The values are defined in the Docker Compose file installed on the server.

### Authentication failures
All authentication failures are logged in `journald` with a fixed format:
`<date> <hostname> <container>: ERROR <date> signals 19 <timestamp> COLANDER_AUTH_FAILURE username:[<user>] email:[<email address>] ip:[<IP address of the client>] datetime:[<date>] routable:[<True if the IP address is public, False otherwise>]`

## üíª Backups
A *bash* script is automatically installed in `/home/colander/colander/scripts`, when called, it creates:
* a dump of Colander database
* a dump of Threatr database (if deployed)
* a snapshot of Elasticsearch indices
* an archive containing all files stored in Minio

You can either run it on your server (`./scripts/backup`) or with Ansible on your laptop:
```
ansible-playbook -J -i production.yml playbooks/backup-colander.yml
```

The backups are stored in `/home/colander/colander/backups/` in a folder named with the date of the backup. The folder structure looks like this:
```
/home/colander/colander/backups/
`-- 2025_02_18-13_47_01
    |-- colander-db
    |   `-- backup_2025_02_18T13_47_02.sql.gz
    |-- elasticsearch
    |   `-- elasticsearch-2025_02_18-13_47_03.tgz
    |-- minio
    |   `-- minio-2025_02_18-13_47_03.tgz
    `-- threatr-db
        `-- backup_2025_02_18T13_47_03.sql.gz
```

You are free to use your favorite backup tool to schedule them according to your backup policies. We only provide the script to create the dumps and archives to be backed up.

Alternatively, you can create an archive of all Docker volumes after shutting down the whole stack. 


## üíª Tear down Colander
If you want to completely uninstall Colander, run the playbook `teardown-colander.yml`. All containers, volumes, images, data, backups, configuration files will be permanently deleted. This action cannot be reverted.

```
ansible-playbook -J -K -i production.yml playbooks/teardown-colander.yml
```

The playbook will ask you the password of the user `colander` and the password of your vault.
